Welcome to ZOOpt
================

ZOOpt is a python package for ***zeroth-order optimization***, which is
also called as ***derivative-free optimization*** and ***black-box
optimization***. This type of algorithms covers evolutionary algorithms,
metaheuristic algorithms, and direct search. They can deal with complex
optimization problems such as functions that are not differentiable, not
continuous, with many local optima, and even unknown but only testable.

ZOOpt is an optimization toolbox with three aims. First, ZOOpt collects
theoretical-grounded derivative-free optimization algorithms. Second,
ZOOpt focuses on optimization problems in machine learning, e.g.,
high-dimensional, noisy, and large-scale optimizations. Third, ZOOpt
tries to be a ready-to-use tool for accomplishing real-world machine
learning tasks.

This documentation intends to explain what ZOOpt can do and how to use
it.
